# 🌊 Wave Interference Pattern Generator

Web-based visualiser of ***2-Point Source Interference Patterns***, and more.  Allows adding additional points and changing the configurations.

May run a bit sluggish depending on your system, ideally you would screen-record and speed up the animation.

🡆 ***see http://braksator.github.io/waves for live online demo***


*************************************

#### Color Gradient Effect
Since the wave fluctuates continuously, the colors smoothly transition:

- Blue dominates low areas (troughs of the sine wave).
- Green appears at neutral zones (wave value near zero), with cyan below and yellow above.
- Red emerges at high peaks (wave crests).
