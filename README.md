# ðŸŒŠ Wave Interference Pattern Generator

Web-based visualiser of ***2-Point Source Interference Patterns***, and more.  Allows adding additional points and changing the configurations.

May run a bit sluggish depending on your system, ideally you would screen-record and speed up the animation.

*************************************

#### Wave colour map effect

- Blue dominates low areas (troughs of the sine wave).
- Green appears at neutral zones (wave value near zero), with cyan below and yellow above.
- Red emerges at high peaks (wave crests).

#### Usability tips

- The slider controls can be nudged slightly using the up/down arrows on your keyboard.
